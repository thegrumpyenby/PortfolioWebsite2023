PRIVACY POLICY
I like to keep it simple, so here we go.

WHAT KIND OF DATA DOES THIS WEBSITE COLLECT
Unless you choose to send me a message using my contact form or comment on the blog, no personal data is collected.

If you use the contact form, I will collect the name, email address, pronouns and message you enter.

If you comment on my blog, the name and email address you give are collected.

WHAT DO I DO WITH SAID DATA
If you have used my contact form, I will use your email address to reply to your message.

I will put said name, email address and pronouns on file in my clients/potential clients list. I won’t contact you about anything that doesn’t directly or indirectly relate to our work together.

I will also use the info you have given me to google you and check you out on LinkedIn because I like to know who I’m dealing with before I consider working with someone. Due diligence and all.

COOKIES
My website uses the necessary cookies by Squarespace and various third-party providers, such as via embedded YouTube videos etc. I don’t run Google Analytics on this website, and Squarespace Analytics has been turned off.
