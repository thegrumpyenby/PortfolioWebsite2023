# New Portfolio Website 2023

I pulled this website up fairly quickly when my Squarespace subscription was about to renew and I decided I wasn’t willing to pay them loads of money for a shitty product anymore.
## Why did you hardcode this?
I chose to hardcode the site in HTML and CSS using a template by HTML5 UP because, at this point, HTML and CSS are what I have learned and at least know my way around. I wanted to use this as an opportunity to sharpen my skills rather than semi-learning a new language on the go and failing to finish the site within the time constraints I had (which was a month or so, and it actually ended up taking a bit less than that) while also doing a bunch of other things in my life.
## Do you regret hardcoding it?
No. But there were moments when I did question my choices. This isn’t the most efficient way to pull up a website — you have to manually copy the nav and footer into each page, etc. I don’t think I was truly aware of that before, having only ever used website builders and the one odd Jekyll installation in the past.

But I learned a lot with this project — and a learning project is what I see it as — and I think I will continue to learn a lot as I try to make it more responsive and accessible in the future. With regards to that, please bear with me. I will get to it but I have an entire 45-min talk to write in the next 2 weeks, and I’m starting a new job as well. There is no excuse for an inaccessible and not-very-responsive website but I hope you’ll accept my reason, which is that I am only 1 human with 1 ADHD brain. ;)
## So how are you going to make it better?
On my list for the upcoming weeks are the following main todos:
* adding ALT text because I didn’t in my hurry to see if things were working; bad practice, I know, I will do it smarter next time
* figuring out how aria labels work and adding those
* adding media queries for my flexboxes which I added, which is why the template doesn’t handle their responsiveness out of the box
* checking how accessible my site is via keyboard, screenreader etc.

Feel free to let me know (in a beginner-friendly way) what you think I should/could improve.

At some point, as I keep learning to code, I will probably redo the entire thing using a static site builder. But for now, this’ll have to do.
